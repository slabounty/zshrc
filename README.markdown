# My .zshrc setup

This is my personal .zsh directory setup which contains my .zshrc
and any dependency scripts that my .zshrc uses most likely for its
prompts. It is based on cyphactor

## Installation

    cd ~/
    git clone git@github.com:slabounty/dotzsh.git ~/.zsh
    ln -s ~/.zsh/zshrc .zshrc
